# Description exercise 1

If I give you a text file with all of the words from an English language dictionary, one word per line, how would you find all the anagrams in that text file? Anagrams are words spelled with the same letters but in a different order, like “act” and “cat,” “dog” and “god,” or “rat,” “art,” and “tar.

## Example

input: ["cat", "act", "dog"]
output: [["cat", "act"]]

# Description exercise 2
